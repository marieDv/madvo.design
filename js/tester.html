          The following projects were created over the realm of the past 3 years. Most of them where done for university
          assignments, or just
          for fun. The collection is supposed to grow over time, as I am continuing to experiment with this amazing
          library.

    <p class="text--sm">"Vienna is a halfpipe" is a private project in which I started to learn more about prototyping
      in After Effects. Most of the pictures that I used are my own, just as the Design and execution of the animated
      prototype.</p>

          This is a super small private project I solemnly did for funnies and some practice. I looked at different platforms that allow users to collect images of certain topics and created my own app based on this research. One of the features that might come in handy for users are the tags that content creators can freely choose for all their projects.

      <!-- CAMBUILDER THEME -->
      <h3 class="ic-headline--xl"><span class="circle" style="background-color: orange;"></span>Cambuilder Theme</h3>
      <p class="text--sm">This project was realized within a month during my second internship at Campaigning Bureau in
        Vienna. The marketing agency uses a generic web-builder that allows customers to create small websites for their
        campaigns. During my time there, I was assigned with the task of modernizing the existing design, without losing
        any of its generic functionality. During the design process I got a lot of helpful feedback from my colleagues
        of the marketing and graphic departments, that made it easier for me to reduce my ideas to two final designs.
        Those were then tested with all kinds of possible user content and different screen sizes. The Project
        definitely taught me a lot about UI, UX and Design Systems, but it was also great to be included and take part
        in a big team.</p>
