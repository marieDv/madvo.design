  <p class="text--sm">This project was realized within a month during my second internship at Campaigning Bureau in Vienna. The marketing agency uses a generic web-builder that allows customers to create small websites for their campaigns. During my time there, I was assigned with the task of modernizing the existing design, without losing any of its generic functionality. During the design process I got a lot of helpful feedback from my colleagues of the marketing and graphic departments, that made it easier for me to reduce my ideas to two final designs. Those were then tested with all kinds of possible user content and different screen sizes. The Project definitely taught me a lot about UI, UX and Design Systems, but it was also great to be included and take part in a big team.</p>
